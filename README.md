# voice-notes

This project focusses transcripting speech to text and text to speech (the notes the user is saving) using Googles gTTS and Speech Recognition for python. The notes are stored in the Notion app after speaking out the activation command, which then saves these notes one by one on the Notion app using the database's token and its database id.
